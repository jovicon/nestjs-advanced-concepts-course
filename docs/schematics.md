## nestjs

```bash
## ⚙️ Terminal - generate blank schematic using npx
npx @angular-devkit/schematics-cli blank --name=schematics

## Note: we're going to use npx here, 
##  but note that alternatively - you could install the "@angular-devkit/schematics-cli" package globally 
##  and refer to it as "schematics" instead of using npx - if you prefer.
